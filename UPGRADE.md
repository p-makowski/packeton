```

## UPGRADE FROM 2.0 to 2.1

The metadata root format `/packages.json` has been changed. Now it is configurable. By default, for performance it depends on Composer `User-Agent`
If you use `/packages.json` API directly (without composer) please add query parameter `ua=1` for 1 format.
See [metadata configuration](/README.md#configuration)

Before:
```json
{
    "packages": [],
    "notify": "/downloads/%package%",
    "notify-batch": "/downloads/",
    "metadata-changes-url": "/metadata/changes.json",
    "providers-url": "/p/%package%$%hash%.json",
    "metadata-url": "/p2/%package%.json",
    "provider-includes": {
        "p/providers$%hash%.json": {
            "sha256": "af2f8f8f8b403ef309e0aca59b080b65fd7465ede21c12a157a1422af8001f42"
        }
    },
    "available-packages": ["okvpn/cron-bundle"]
}
```

After:

```json
{
    "packages": [],
    "notify": "/downloads/%package%",
    "notify-batch": "/downloads/",
    "metadata-changes-url": "/metadata/changes.json",
    "providers-url": "/p/%package%$%hash%.json",
    "metadata-url": "/p2/%package%.json",
    "available-packages": ["okvpn/cron-bundle"]
}
```

The lazy route `/p/%package%.json` now return Ð¡omposer compatible data:

```
{"packages": {"name": {versions}}
```
